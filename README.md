Taking the transpose (transfer) of the matrix means the displacement of the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this process is the transpose (transfer) of the initial matrix. At this stage, the transpose (transfer) of a matrix of kxn becomes a matrix of nxk. For example, let's have an A matrix. The transpose (transfer) of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (A over T).

For example, the transpose (transfer) of the following 2x3 A matrix is a 2x3 A^T matrix.
